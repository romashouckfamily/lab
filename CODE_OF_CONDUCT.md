# CODE OF CONDUCT

1. I take personal responsibility for my own learning. Only I will know when I understand the course material or how much homework/practice is enough. 
	- What does personal responsibility mean to you? 
2. I will ask questions when I do not understand. I will not copy and paste solutions from other students without understanding the code myself. I will ask questions in a way that shows my effort to problem-solve: sharing error messages, hypotheses, and steps I have already taken to resolve the issue. 
3. I will help others if/when they ask.
4. I will respect the progress of myself and my peers, and practice not comparing myself to others.
5. I will show up on time, and if I need to arrive late, leave early, or miss class, I will let Melanie know in advance.
