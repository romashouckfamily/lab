##3. [60 minutes] Introduce new concept: Ajax requests to external endpoints using the guitar assignment
- What is an AJAX request? It's a way of loading data from a server without requiring a page reload. 
- jQuery provides the $.ajax method — and several convenience methods — to make it easier to work with XHRs across browsers.
- Read through the jQuery fundamentals website together: http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/ajax-deferreds
- Explore jQuery diagram: https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_intro.asp
- What are the types of AJAX requests? GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Try it out with the Pokemon API. Let's get an image for our cursor with: https://pokeapi.co/
- Briefly discuss CORS: https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/

## [10 minutes] BREAK

## 4. [30 minutes] In-class pair assignment: try using jQuery yourself in your project using the pokemon API
- Your request URL should be in this format: `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/`
- Make sure to get different pokemon every time... don't just leave the ID as 1 forever
- You can select the cursor with `$('body').css('cursor', 'url(PUT_URL_HERE), auto')`

## 5. [30 minutes] Introduce Coding demonstration and discussion Part 2
